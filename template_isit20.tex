Non-linear activation function plays vital role in artificial neural network.
In this paper, we show that under certain conditions Hermite orthogonal polynomial
is universally good for orthogonal input features. Our study shares insight in the expressive

\section{Introduction}
In artificial neural network, activation functions are applied to linear combinations of input features from last layer and contribute magically to the whole system.
There are many choices for activation function \cite{laudani2015training} and none of them performs best for all problems.
Previous study of activation function focuses mostly on the training efficiency and cost when choosing activation function.
However, theoretical property is also important as a guarantee to the functionality of activation function in neural network.
In this paper, we study how the activation function influences the network loss
when the activation term is constrained to a small perturbation of linear function.

Besides local perturbation assumption, we consider the simplest neural network with one output node and several input node.
We also require the input features are orthogonal to each other.
This can be simply achieved by commonly used techniques such as PCA.
Our measure of activation function is not restricted to one specific problem but is averaged over many different problems.
We find that the averaged loss function is minimized when the perturbation term is Hermite orthogonal polynomial.
Hermite polynomial as activation function has been argued beneficial previously \cite{ma2005constructive} and our result confirms this fact to some extent.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section \ref{sec:mm}, the universally good activation function problem
is formulated mathematically.
In Section \ref{sec:hp}, the Hermite polynomial solution for our problem is briefly deduced.
In Section \ref{sec:er}, numerical experiments are conducted to verify our results.
In Section \ref{sec:con}, conclusion is given.

Throught this paper, we use $X$ to represent random variables,
$\underline{X}$ to represent random vectors,
$\bm{X}$ to represent random matrix,
lower case $x$ to represent a numerical value,
$\underline{x}$ as a numerical vector and $\bm{x}$ as numerical matrix.

\section{Mathematical Model}\label{sec:mm}
We consider one node neural networks, whose structure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ns}.
Given a k dimensional random vector $\underline{X}=(X_1, \dots, X_k)$ and a random variable $Y$.
Our goal is to predict $Y$ using the neural network with $\underline{X}$ as input.
To be more specific, $Y$ is approximated by $ \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i X_i)$.
For a given problem, we have $n$ data pairs $(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ and
the L2 loss function is given by
$\ell_2(\underline{y}, \bm{x}) = \norm{\underline{y} - \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i \underline{x}_i)}^2 $
where $\underline{x}_i= (x_{i1}, \dots, x_{in})^T$ is the i-th column of the feature vector $\bm{x}$ and
$\underline{y} = (y_1, \dots, y_n)$ is the label vector. $\sigma$ is applied to a vector elementwise.
The optimal weight for a given activation function $\sigma$ is the solution to $\min \ell_2(\underline{y}, \bm{x})$.
\begin{figure}\label{fig:ns}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{network_structure.eps}
\end{figure}

For different problems, we suppose $\underline{y}, \bm{x}$ are drawing from some distribution $G$.
That is, we treat them as random vectors and rewrite them as $\underline{Y}, \bm{X}$ and
we are insterested to find a function $\sigma$ which minimizes
$\E[ \min \ell_2(\underline{Y}, \bm{X})]$.
Our contraint on the activation function $\sigma$ is that
$\sigma(z) = z + \epsilon \xi(z)$.
$\epsilon$ is a small constant.
$\E[\xi(\bm{X}\underline{w})]=1$ where
$\bm{X}\underline{w} = \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \underline{X}_i$ and  $\underline{w}=(w_1, \dots, w_k)$.

We formulate universally good activation function $\sigma$ as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{def:ug}
Suppose $G$ is a distribution space for $(\bm{X}, \underline{Y})$,
$F$ is a function space for $\xi(z)$.
$\mathrm{E}[\sigma]$ is called the averaged estimation error whose definition is
\begin{align}\label{eq:ug}
\mathrm{E}(\sigma) = & \E[ \min_{\underline{w}} \norm{\underline{Y} - \sigma(\bm{X} \underline{w})}^2] \nonumber\\
s.t. \,& \sigma(z) = z + \epsilon \xi(z) \nonumber \\
&\E[\norm{\xi(\bm{X}\underline{w})}^2]=1
\end{align}
The function $\sigma^*$ which minimizes $\mathrm{E}(\sigma)$
is called the universally good activation function for the single node neural network.
\end{definition}

We restrict our discussion of universally good activation function to local regime analysis to make the analytic solution possible.
We try to compare the performance of non-linearity with linear function and this restriction does not lose generality.

Furthermore, we assume $\underline{Y}$ is Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix $\frac{1}{n} I_n$ and
$\bm{X}$ is uniformly distributed random orthogonal matrix \cite{rm}.
$\underline{Y}$ and $\bm{X}$ are independent.
This defines our distribution space $G$.
For functional space $F$, we choose $P_m(z)$,
which consists of polynomials with the highest degree no more than $m$.
\subsection{Linear Function}
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:linear}
When $\epsilon = 0, \sigma_0(z) = z, \mathrm{E}(\sigma_0) = 1 - \frac{k}{n}$ from Definition \ref{def:ug}.
\end{proposition}

Proposition \ref{prop:linear} is the case for linear approximation.
It says the averaged estimation error $\mathrm{E}$ for linear function is equal to $\frac{k}{n}$.
This result is consistent with our intuition
since we use $k$ degrees of freedom to estimate arbitrary vector in $n$ dimentional space.

The proof of Proposition \ref{prop:linear} depends on the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:A}
Suppose $\bm{X}$ is uniformly distributed random orthogonal matrix, $\bm{A} = \bm{X}\bm{X}^T$.
Then $\E[\bm{A}] = \frac{k}{n} I_n$.
\end{lemma}
We defined random matrix $\bm{A}$ in Lemma \ref{lem:A} for notation convenience.
Since $\bm{X}$ is orthogonal, $\bm{A}$ is idempotent. That is, we have $\bm{A}^2 = \bm{A}$.

\begin{proof}
When $\epsilon = 0$, the optimal $\underline{w} = \bm{X}^T\underline{Y}$. Therefore
$\E[\norm{\underline{Y} - \sigma(\bm{X} \underline{w})}^2] = \E[\norm{\underline{Y}-\bm{X}\bm{X}^T\underline{Y}}^2]$
The expectation can be taken by $\underline{Y}$ first and then by $\bm{X}$.
Let $\underline{Z} = (I-\bm{A}) \underline{Y}$ which transforms a Gaussian random vector $\underline{Y}$.
for given $\bm{X}$. Therefore $\E_{\underline{Y}}[\norm{\underline{Z}}^2] = \Tr[(I-A)^T\Cov[Y](I-A)]
= \frac{1}{n}\Tr[I - A]$. Using Lemma \ref{lem:A}. $\mathrm{E}(\sigma) = 1 - \frac{k}{n}$ follows.
\end{proof}

Proposition \ref{prop:linear} also justifies our choice of probability space $G$.
That is, we choose proper distribution for $\bm{X}$ and $\underline{Y}$ to make the linear case tractable.
\subsection{Nonlinear perturbation}
For very small $\epsilon$, we can quantify the averaged estimation error $E[\sigma]$ using the
following proposition
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:Esigma}
$\mathrm{E}[\sigma] = \mathrm{E}[\sigma_0] +
\mathrm{C}[\xi]\epsilon^2 + o(\epsilon^2)$
where
\begin{align}\notag
\mathrm{C}[\xi]= & \E[\norm{\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2 -
\norm{\bm{X}^T\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2 - \\
&\norm{\bm{X}^T \nabla\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})(Y-\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2]
\end{align}
\end{proposition}
Proposition \ref{prop:Esigma} gets the second order approximation for $\mathrm{E}$.
The coefficient of $\epsilon$ is zero while it is not obvious to determine the sign for 
the coefficient of $\epsilon^2$. Therefore, we consider $\sigma \in P_m(z)$ and
get the following result:
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:quadratic}
If
$\xi(z) = \sum_{i=0}^m q_i z^i$,
and $m << k$, then we have 
\begin{align}
\mathrm{C}[\sigma] &= (1-\frac{k}{n}) p^T M p \notag\\
\textrm{where }p_i &= \frac{k^{i/2}}{n^{- 1/2 + i}}q_i \notag\\
M_{ij} =& -\delta(i,j)(i-1)(j-1)(i+j-3)!! 
\end{align}
The constraint on vector $q$ is through
\begin{align}
p^T N p & = 1 \notag\\
N_{ij}  & = \delta(i,j)(i+j-1)!!
\end{align}
\end{proposition}

From Proposition \ref{prop:quadratic}, we can inspect the impact of non-linear perturbation on the average error. Suppose we choose

\section{Experiment Result}\label{sec:er}

\subsection{Templates}

The paper (A4 or letter size, double-column format, not exceeding
5~pages) should be formatted as shown in this sample \LaTeX{} file.

The use of Microsoft Word instead of \LaTeX{} is strongly
discouraged. However, acceptable formatting may be achieved by using
the template that can be downloaded from the ISIT 2020 website:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://2020.ieee-isit.org/}
\end{center}

Users of other text processing systems should attempt to duplicate the
style of this example, in particular the sizes and type of font, as
closely as possible.


\subsection{Formatting}

The style of references, equations, figures, tables, etc., should be
the same as for the \emph{IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory}. The source file of this template paper contains many more
instructions on how to format your paper. So, example code for
different numbers of authors, for figures and tables, and references
can be found (they are commented out).

For instructions on how to typeset math, in particular for equation
arrays with broken equations, we refer to \cite{typesetmoser}.

Pages should not be numbered and there should be no footer or header
(both will be added during the production of the proceedings). The
affiliation shown for authors should constitute a sufficient mailing
address for persons who wish to write for more details about the

\subsection{PDF Requirements}

Only electronic submissions in form of a PDF file will be
accepted. The PDF file has to be PDF/A compliant. A common problem is
missing fonts. Make sure that all fonts are embedded. (In some cases,
printing a PDF to a PostScript file, and then creating a new PDF with
Acrobat Distiller, may do the trick.) More information (including
suitable Acrobat Distiller Settings) is available from the IEEE
website \cite{IEEE:pdfsettings, IEEE:AuthorToolbox}.


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}

We conclude by pointing out that on the last page the columns need to

% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


% *** PDF and URL PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
